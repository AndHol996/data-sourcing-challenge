I would like to acknowledge my teacher, N. Sanka, and TA, V. Reddy for assistance during examples in class.

## Code Sourcing and Influences
The code was influenced by the OSU AI Bootcamp lessons. Code took influence from "Convert the column type from string to datetime format in Pandas dataframe" by shubham__ranjan on geeksforgeeks.org for Code Cell 10, Line 4 of athletic_sales_analysis.jpynb and from "How to check if any value is NaN in a pandas DataFrame" by AJ Welch from atlassian.com for Code Cell 8, Lines 3 of athletic_sales_analysis.jpynb.
